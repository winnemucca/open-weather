# Client

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Api's were written with both 3.0 and 2.5.  

I was unable to complete api requests for daily weather info using 2.5


## Application was a quick 1/2 day test.  I aimed for 1-2 hours but ran into issues with one api.

## Future goals
 - write unit tests
 - initiate signal store
 - create global search.  i have an express backend locally running but I was unable to refactor rest of code in timely manner
 - Add caching
